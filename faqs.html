Quoting a 1967 judgment, the Supreme Court of India reiterated in 1996 that the game requires considerable skills, and hence the game of poker is considered a skill-based game. It has also been observed that any game based on skills cannot be prohibited, as they are protected by the fundamental rights of the Indian citizens.

                  <p>Poker is one of the most popular card games played worldwide.</p>
                  <p>There are different poker games, but they all share some standard features. In general, the goal of poker is to win money by betting on hands of cards that you think will be better than your opponents' hands. In most poker games, players are dealt a hand of cards, and then they take turns betting on their hands. The player with the best hand at the end of the hand wins the pot.</p>

                  <p>You might be surprised to know this, but at a single point in time, you can play in between five to twelve poker tables.</p>
